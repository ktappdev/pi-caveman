# 🪨 pi-caveman

**Why use many token when few do trick.**

A [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi) extension that cuts **~75% of output tokens** while keeping full technical accuracy. Based on [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) by [Julius Brussee](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee).

### 🗣️ Normal (69 tokens)

> "The reason your React component is re-rendering is likely because you're creating a new object reference on each render cycle. When you pass an inline object as a prop, React's shallow comparison sees it as a different object every time, which triggers a re-render. I'd recommend using useMemo to memoize the object."

### 🪨 Caveman (19 tokens)

> "New object ref each render. Inline object prop = new ref = re-render. Wrap in `useMemo`."

## Install

```bash
pi install /path/to/pi-caveman
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/you/pi-caveman
```

## Usage

```
/caveman              Toggle on (full) / off
/caveman lite         Professional, no fluff
/caveman full         Classic caveman (default)
/caveman ultra        Maximum compression
/caveman wenyan-lite  Semi-classical Chinese
/caveman wenyan       Full 文言文
/caveman wenyan-ultra Extreme 文言文
/caveman off          Disable
```

The active level persists across turns and session restarts. A status indicator appears in the footer when active.

## Levels

| Level | Style | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🪶 **Lite** | No filler. Full sentences. Professional but tight. | "Your component re-renders because you create a new object reference each render." |
| 🪨 **Full** | Drop articles, fragments OK. Classic caveman. | "New object ref each render. Wrap in `useMemo`." |
| 🔥 **Ultra** | Abbreviations, arrows, maximum compression. | "Inline obj prop → new ref → re-render. `useMemo`." |
| 📜 **文言文 Lite** | Semi-classical Chinese, grammar intact. | "組件頻重繪，以每繪新生對象參照故。" |
| 📜 **文言文** | Full classical terseness. | "物出新參照，致重繪。useMemo Wrap之。" |
| 📜 **文言文 Ultra** | Extreme classical compression. | "新參照→重繪。useMemo Wrap。" |

## How It Works

The extension hooks `before_agent_start` to append caveman communication rules to the system prompt at the selected intensity. The active level is persisted as a custom session entry and restored on session start. Auto-clarity rules tell the model to drop caveman mode for security warnings or irreversible actions.
